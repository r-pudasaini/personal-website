      So it's been some time since I updated this.
      I've been pretty busy figuring out what I want to do with myself in terms of a career in programming.
      I'd really like to see if I can rebuild this website in React, but at the same time I've been exploring backend projects,
      which I always thought was what I wanted to do for a job.

      <br>
      <br>

      I've also been pretty active on LeetCode. I used to avoid any kind of algorithmic problem solving like the plague, but somehow I've come a point where 
      hitting the 'submit code' button and seeing the golden words "all testcases passed" on the first try is a dopamine rush unlike anything else.

      <br>
      <br>

      It's also worth noting that the school year just started. One problem I had with many of the CS classes I took at Virginia tech 
      was that the courses I was required to take seemed really out of touch with what companies want you to know nowadays, even for 
      internship positions.
      <br>
      <br>

      In fact, one of the classes I'm in this semester will have us build a full stack application from the group up, as our semester project.
      Such a class isn't available to undergrads until possibly their senior-level capstone class, and here I am taking it in grad school.

      <br>
      <br>

      I'm not sure how useful my other classes will be, but I'm sure I'll still learn a lot from them. Only time will tell, though.
