    <p class="page-writing">
      So I've been working on the website for a few weeks now. I've learned HTML and CSS, I've picked up a little bit of bootstrap 
      to develop the navigation bar on this website, and to easily generate that link row in my homepage, and I've spent a lot of 
      time experimenting with design choices, like element positioning and color.

      <br><br>

      It wasn't nearly as painful as other developers make it out to be. Some of my friends from college spoke about how I'd
      never catch them building a front-end, which naturally made me feel apprehensive on any User Experience Task.
      <br><br>

      And yet building this website has been a really enjoyable experience so far. There's a certain level of freedom front-end 
      rewards you with that I'm not sure you'd find in backend development, but these are just my thoughts for now. 
      <br><br>

      Who knows? Maybe as I continue learning as much as I can about front-end, including Javascript frameworks like React,
      I'll understand what all the notoriety is for.
