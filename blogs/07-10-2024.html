        So I am pretty much finished implementing my personal website. 

        I’m really happy with how it looks, and that this was the product of my first attempt at web development. Using HTML, CSS with some Bootstrap classes, and vanilla Javascript. 
        
        <br><br>

        While these are some of the oldest and well known tools for web-development, there are many other frameworks like React JS, Python Flask, and Svelte that simplify the front-end design process. Was it really worth investing a couple weeks to create a portfolio website out of HTML and CSS when I could have been developing other project, built with more modern tools instead? 
        <br><br>

        I think it was. I was able to create a perfectly presentable web-page, with various components, and I learned so much as I did it. I think the foundational knowledge of HTML and CSS are essential to understand before moving on to more advanced tools, since I can appreciate exactly what these new tools are simplifying. 
        <br><br>

        For example, the navigation bar on my website was made by the Bootstrap Navbar class, and I only needed to prepare my navigation bar design once before copy-pasting it into each HTML page. That task was simple, but if I had a bigger website with many more static pages it’d be really tedious to go to each one and paste the bar. Worse, what if I wanted to modify the bar, or change its color?  
        I’d have to go ahead and do it all over again for each page. 
        <br><br>

        While it’s possible to simplify this repetition by using Javascript to create the bar for you on each page, you’d still need to reference this script from every single file. The same copy paste task you needed to do with the Nav-Bar’s code. Although I’m not certain, it stands to reason that modern frameworks provide facilities to guarantee this navigation bar appears at the top of  every single page, while only needing to be referenced from one module of code. 
        <br><br>

        While one could argue that I should have attempted to re-build this project using an advanced framework, I think it was better to gain experience with the fundamentals. As I have learned many times through college, there is no good substitute for a strong foundation when you’re trying to become more advanced with a skill. Thus, I am proud to claim that this website was coded using only HTML as a skeleton, CSS for decoration, Bootstrap to provide a tiny bit of boilerplate, and vanilla Javascript for the photo library. In fact, I am obligated to credit <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QghhoJBdw7A" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" class="links no-bold">this</a> YouTube video by Mr. Web Designer for a most fitting, beginner friendly photo library. Much of the code they showcase was used in my own photo library.

        <br><br>

        Lastly, I’d like to end this post by expressing how satisfying and fulfilling front-end development can be. Yes, I was frustrated sometimes by how nitty-gritty CSS can be, and that sometimes it’ll disobey you as if its existence depended on it, but isn’t that a usual experience in Computer Science? I view these struggles as tests of our grit to keep going on. So while I’m certain I’ll face such struggles again, perhaps in the near future, I’m excited to think about the amazing things I will create!
